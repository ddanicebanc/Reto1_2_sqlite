# Madagascapp  

## Project Status  
**Completed**  

## Objective  
Madagascapp is a comprehensive mobile ERP application designed to empower sales professionals by streamlining the management of partners, orders, and visits. It enables users to efficiently browse and interact with a product catalog, as well as download essential data—including products, user information, and catalogs—from a remote MySQL server. Additionally, Madagascapp offers functionality to upload newly created partners and sales orders, ensuring seamless data synchronization between the app and the server.  

The app is part of the final project for the Multiplatform App Development course in CEBANC.

## Installation  
Madagascapp is available for Android mobile devices running Android 8.0 or above.  

## Usage  
- **Registration:** The user (salesman) selects a preloaded user from a list downloaded from the remote server and sets up a username and password to register.  
- **Main Activity:** The primary interface includes a map view, where the user can see points of interest (currently limited to the delegation location).  
- **Data Synchronization:** Syncing data with the remote server only requires an active internet connection.  

## To-Do  
- Add the visits location to the main activity map to have them visible at a glance.  
- Add the ability to group visits by month in the visit list activity.
